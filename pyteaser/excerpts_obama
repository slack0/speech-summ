    u'And that\u2019s what I intend to do, and I think that\u2019s what Ken Salazar intends to do.',
    u'And I think that\u2019s important for all of us to do.',
    u'That\u2019s why last Friday, I also signed an executive order establishing the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.',
    u'And those skimmers, those boats, that boom, the people who are out there collecting some of the oil that\u2019s already hit shore, they can be moved and redirected at any point.']
'****************************************'
[   u'And I want everybody to know that everybody here -- at every level -- is working night and day to end this crisis.',
    u'Gulf Coast residents should know that we\u2019ve gathered all pertinent information regarding available assistance and the federal response in one place at whitehouse.gov.',
    u'We\u2019re also going to continue to do whatever it takes to help Americans whose livelihoods have been upended by this spill.',
    u'Today, there are more than 20,000 people in the region working around the clock to contain and clean up this spill.',
    u'To the people of the Gulf Coast:\xa0 I know that you\u2019ve weathered your fair share of trials and tragedy.']
'****************************************'
[   u'And when you think back to the health care debate, despite calls for a single-payer, government-run health care plan, we passed reform that maintains our system of private health insurance.',
    u'Address at Carnegie Mellon University on the Economy Let me begin by thanking Dr.',
    u'They saw the cost of things like health care and college tuition reach record highs.',
    u'But we can pursue such production only if it\u2019s safe, and only if it\u2019s used as a short-term solution while we transition to a clean energy economy.',
    u'The time has come, once and for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future.']
'****************************************'
[   u'And I\u2019m told that soon after the Promise was established, a first grader approached the superintendent at the time and declared to her:\xa0 \u201cI\u2019m going to college.\u201d\xa0 First grader.\xa0 \u201cI\u2019m going to college.',
    u'Now, together as a community, you\u2019ve embraced the motto of this school district:\xa0 \u201cEvery child, every opportunity, every time.\u201d\xa0 Every time.',
    u'Folks in Washington know, folks across the country know, and hopefully after tonight, everybody knows.',
    u'And I\u2019m here tonight because I think that America has a lot to learn from Kalamazoo Central about what makes for a successful school in this new century.',
    u'And it ran just after this school had been chosen as one of the six finalists in our Race to the Top Commencement Challenge.']
'****************************************'
[   u'Today, the United Nations Security Council voted overwhelmingly to sanction Iran for its continued failure to live up to its obligations.',
    u'They will impose restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, its ballistic missile program, and, for the first time, its conventional military.',
    u'I want and hope for the people of Iran that the government of Iran will make a different choice.',
    u'We made clear from the beginning of my administration that the United States was prepared to pursue diplomatic solutions to address the concerns over Iranian nuclear programs.',
    u'Iran further violated its own obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions to suspend uranium enrichment.']
'****************************************'
[   u'You hold our military families together, so we honor your service as well.',
    u'During her visit, Michelle had a message for their families and for all military families:\xa0 America is going to keep faith with you, too.',

    u'Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries.',
    u'And tonight, I\u2019ve returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we\u2019re waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens.']
'****************************************'
[   u'And it\u2019s because you know our health care system so well that you\u2019ve been such a fierce advocate for its reform.',
    u'And my task as President -- our task as a people -- is to ensure that our health care system is worthy of your efforts.',
    u'And by focusing on primary medicine, we will finally recognize the role of all talented and skilled health care providers -- including nurses.',
    u'I want to thank Marla Weston, the CEO of the American Nurses Association.',

[   u'And I know I\u2019ve missed out on moments in my daughters\u2019 lives that I\u2019ll never get back, and that\u2019s a loss that\u2019s hard to accept.',
    u'What we can do is come together and support fathers who are willing to step up and be good partners and parents and providers.',
    u'But ultimately, we know that the decision to be a good father -- that\u2019s up to us, each of us, as individuals.',
    u'We know that children who grow up without a father are more likely to live in poverty.',
    u'And we did this because we know the vital role fathers play in the lives of our children.']
'****************************************'
[   u'I look forward to working with General Petraeus and my entire national security team to succeed in our mission.',
    u"Let me conclude by saying that it was a difficult decision to come to the conclusion that I've made today.",

    u"Today I accepted General Stanley McChrystal's resignation as commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.",
    u'I believe that this mission demands unity of effort across our alliance and across my national security team.']
'****************************************'
[   u'So these are the essential elements of comprehensive immigration reform.',
    u'And it\u2019s made worse by a failure of those of us in Washington to fix a broken immigration system.',
    u'But I believe we can put politics aside and finally have an immigration system that\u2019s accountable.',
    u'Indeed, after years of patchwork fixes and ill-conceived revisions, the legal immigration system is as broken as the borders.',
    u'Immigration reform is no exception.']

    u'Ultimately, there\u2019s no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street.',
    u'The fact is every American -- from Main Street to Wall Street -- has a stake in our financial system.',
    u'It was a crisis born of a failure of responsibility from certain corners of Wall Street to the halls of power in Washington.',
    u'Wall Street banks and firms invest the capital that makes it possible for start-ups to sell new products.']

    u'On a day when others sought to destroy, we have chosen to build, with a National Day of Service and Remembrance that summons the inherent goodness of the American people.',

    u'For human rights to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression, we need your voices to speak out.',
    u'But the founding of the United Nations itself is a testament to human progress.',
    u'In times of economic unease, there can also be an anxiety about human rights.']
'****************************************'
[   u'And that\u2019s going to require all of us, including me, to work harder at building consensus.',

    u'I\u2019m going to start off with Ben Feller at AP. \xa0 Thank you, Mr.',

    u'For in Asia and around the world, India is not simply emerging; India has emerged.',
    u'The United States will not abandon the people of Afghanistan -- or the region -- to violent extremists who threaten us all.',
    u'Indeed, the just and sustainable international order that America seeks includes a United Nations that is efficient, effective, credible and legitimate.',
    u'In the United States, my administration has worked to make government more open and transparent and accountable to people.']
'****************************************'
[   u'First, the friendship between the United States and Indonesia can advance our mutual interest in development.',
    u'Yesterday, President Yudhoyono and I announced a new Comprehensive Partnership between the United States and Indonesia.',
    u'And I can promise you -- no matter what setbacks may come, the United States is committed to human progress.',
    u'But we also know that relations between the United States and Muslim communities have frayed over many years.',

    u'It is my privilege to present our nation\u2019s highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, to a soldier as humble as he is heroic: Staff Sergeant Salvatore A. Giunta.',
    u'During the first of his two tours of duty in Afghanistan, Staff Sergeant Giunta was forced early on to come to terms with the loss of comrades and friends.',
    u'So we are also joined here today by several members of Congress, including both senators and several representatives from Staff Sergeant Giunta\u2019s home state of Iowa.',

    u'This is somebody who has helped change the way we fight wars and win wars in the 21st century.',

    u"You can answer -- \xa0 First, my message is, I don't believe that's true because in January, they will be in the majority.",
    u"So I think that's healthy, too, because everybody has got to give a little.",

    u'Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs.',

    u'Today, American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets.',
    u"The fact is, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO don't agree on a whole lot.",

    u'In a world that\u2019s more connected and more competitive, other nations look at this moment as their moment, their turn to win the jobs and industries of our time.',
    u'It means investing in the skills and training of our people, just like it\u2019s taking place at this university.',
    u'And that\u2019s who we\u2019re going to have to be again -- a young nation that teaches the world to march forward.']

    u'In the face of this injustice, the United States and the international community moved swiftly.']
'****************************************'
[   u'Today I authorized the Armed Forces of the United States to begin a limited military action in Libya in support of an international effort to protect Libyan civilians.',
    u'I am deeply aware of the risks of any military action, no matter what limits we place on it.',
    u'This is not an outcome that the United States or any of our partners sought.',

    u'But when you look at the long-term trends, there are going to be more ups in gas prices than downs in gas prices.',
    u'Both invest more in clean energy than we do, even though we are a larger economy and a substantially larger user of energy.',
    u'And for Americans that are already struggling to get by, a hike in gas prices really makes their lives that much harder.',
