- This is the age of information overload
  -- People want gists of conversations, speeches, talks, interviews...

- Overarching goal:
  -- Analyze spoken text - and extract summaries from it

- Why? and Why spoken text?
  -- Because comments, remarks and answers are delivered off-hand and
     at a certain level bring out the true beliefs of a person

  -- Prepared remarks and written speeches do not often reflect
     the latent beliefs


- Can we generate summary statements from a spoken comments?
  - Can such summaries be based on prior information?

Data is all around us. We are immersed and inundated by it.
The glut of information coming through our devices inundates the ever
decreasing attention spans. The value of a piece of information is inversely
proportional to its length and also to the attention span of the receiver.
Information consumed in bite-sized chunks has a better chance of sticking -
and has a better chance of being perceived as useful. Summarizing and capturing
the intent behind text in a meaningful way is necessary to address this issue.
